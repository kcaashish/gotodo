# gotodo

It is a personal project, a simple todo app in golang. I have used standard go library for most of the work to understand key concepts of  
backend development like request-response cycle, authentication, authorization, restful architecture, and so on. I have used following extra packages  
to help me in the development process: 
- [github.com/google/uuid](https://github.com/google/uuid) for generating primary keys
- [golang-migrate](https://github.com/golang-migrate/migrate) for database migration
- [github.com/jmoiron/sqlx](https://github.com/jmoiron/sqlx) for database integration
- [github.com/lib/pq](https://github.com/lib/pq) for database integration
- [github.com/golang-jwt/jwt](https://github.com/golang-jwt/jwt) for authentication
